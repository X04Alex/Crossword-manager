Enhancement roadmap for Crossword Manager

High-impact features
1) Timer + Stats
   - In-play timer (start on Play, stop on completion), best time, average time, session time.
   - Progress % (filled vs total white cells), current streak (for daily puzzles).

2) Check / Reveal tools
   - Check cell / word / full grid; highlight incorrect entries.
   - Reveal letter / word; optional penalty indicator; undo support after reveal.

3) Autosave
   - Persist in-progress grid and settings to localStorage.
   - Restore on reload; handle versioning and puzzle identity (hash).

4) Undo / Redo
   - Track edits (cell value changes, black toggles, navigation); multi-step undo/redo.
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+Z).

5) Mobile usability
   - Larger tap targets; tap to select, double-tap to toggle direction.
   - Long-press quick menu for Check/Reveal; on-screen keyboard helpers.

Play experience
6) Pencil vs Pen mode
   - Tentative entries styled differently; convert pencil to pen on confirmation.

7) Notes per clue
   - Small textarea for jotting thoughts, anagrams, cross refs; persisted with autosave.

8) Rebus support
   - Allow multi-letter cells via a small modal or inline editor; render compactly.

9) Navigation upgrades
   - Home/End jump to word edges; Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow to previous/next word.
   - Enter key jumps to next clue; Shift+Enter to previous.

10) Cross-references
    - Detect mentions like "see 12-Down"; clicking jumps and temp-highlights referenced word.

Accessibility & theming
11) ARIA & keyboard
    - Announce selection (row, col, direction, clue). Live region for feedback.
    - Ensure focus order and arrow navigation are consistent.

12) Themes
    - High-contrast and dark mode; theme toggle; save preference.

Builder tools (Edit mode)
13) Symmetry controls
    - Enforce 180Â°/mirror symmetry; live indicator and toggle.

14) Quality checks
    - Connectivity check (white cells reachable), word count, black-square %, pangram flag.

15) Pattern search & word suggestions
    - Pattern matching (e.g., ?A?E?) with wordlists; frequency scores; part-of-speech tags.

16) Assisted fill
    - Suggest fills based on crossings; lock-in selective choices; backtracking engine.

17) Clue editor upgrades
    - Inline editing in list; clue difficulty tags; clue-style hints (anagram, container, etc.).

Sharing & export
18) Export formats
    - .puz / .jpz export; printable PDF with layout.

19) Share progress
    - Link-based share or emoji grid share (spoiler-free), completion summary.

20) Daily puzzle & streaks
    - Seeded daily; archive; streak tracking; calendar view.

Polish & performance
21) Completion celebration
    - Confetti animation, sound cue (toggleable), share button.

22) Performance
    - Debounce expensive DOM updates; avoid full clue list rebuilds; virtualize long lists.

Dev quality
23) Testing
    - Unit tests for navigation/highlighting; E2E tests (Playwright) for typing flows.

24) Settings panel
    - Centralize toggles: auto-advance, error highlighting, sounds, theme, pencil/pen.

Implementation notes
- Timer: start in Play mode, stop on completion; store elapsed time; format HH:MM:SS when >= 1h.
- Completion: snapshot solution on entering Play; check after any edit; overlay on success.
- Check/Reveal: utilities to compare cells with solutionGrid; non-destructive highlight.
- Autosave: serialize grid, clues, mode, elapsed time; auto-restore by puzzle hash.
- Undo/Redo: command stack capturing cell value, selection, direction, and grid ops.
- Accessibility: add ARIA to cells and clues; live region for status messages.
